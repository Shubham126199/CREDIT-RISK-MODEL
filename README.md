PFA the .SAV file which shows codes related to Probability of Default model development and conversion of this PD model into Behavioural Scorecard. It also Includes .CSV file of train/test dataset of feature and target(good_bad borrower) variables. The Area Under receiver operating characteristic curve achieved was 71% i.e considered to be a good model. 

Target-To determine which customer will default on their loans and the associated probabilities of default using Logistic Regression. Finally i calculated the LGD and EAD model. These three components were based upon A-IRB Methodology. Product of these 3 components gave us the Total expected loss of lending club which was around 500 million dollars out of 8 billion of loan given through its platform. Since Capital Adequacy Ration of This organization was well above 10%, it was in better position to hedge against the risk.


I worked on dataset with 2.5 Million customers (all loan data from 2010 to 2018) and 200+ independent variables. Weight of evidence and Information Value was used to perform fine and coarse classing. Final model had around 35 original independent variables.
